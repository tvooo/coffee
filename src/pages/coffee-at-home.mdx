This guide is meant to give you some basics on brewing great coffee and lead you in the right directions should you think of getting some additional equipment.

You can of course get ground coffee from the supermarket, but it will likely be ground to the wrong level and also a limit to the quality of

Go get some beans from your local roaster.
