# Bloom

Bloom is a phase in the manual pourover process that prepares the coffee grounds for the brew.

Freshly roasted coffee beans contain gases that have formed during the roasting process. The more recent the coffee was roasted, the more gas is still trapped inside the beans.

Wetting the grounds before the main brewing process allows the trapped gas to escape[^1] and makes it easier for water to flow through the grounds.
