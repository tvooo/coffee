# Immersion brewing

Immersion brewing is a method for brewing coffee where the coffee grounds get _immersed_ in the water for a period of time.
This stays in contrast to [drip brewing](./drip), where water drips down and constantly _flows_ through the coffee grounds.

Popular brewers using immersion are the [French press](./french-press), the Aeropress, and the Mizudashi bottle used for cold brew. Turkish coffee is also a form of immersion brewing.

Some brewers, such as the Clever Dripper, combine immersion and drip brewing.
