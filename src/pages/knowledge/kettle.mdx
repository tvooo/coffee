# Kettle

A water kettle is used to heat and/or pour water.

For some brewers, like the [french press](./french-press), you can just use your standard household hot water kettle. Their big spouts, however, make it difficult to properly control the water flow, which is important for brewers such as the V60 or Chemex.

<!-- At its most basic, a metal kettle can be used to heat water on a stove — some even support induction stoves. -->

## Gooseneck kettles

For pourover brewing, so-called _gooseneck kettles_ offer greater control than typical household kettles. The name comes from the long, thin spout that — depending on the model — may resemble the long, curvy neck of a goose. The spout restricts the water flow (i.e. the water flows more slowly and evenly) and allows you to pour more precisely over the grounds.

<!-- flow restrictors exist! -->

Some kettles come with builtin thermometers to check the water temperature. Electric kettles — specifically those made for brewing coffee — often have a thermostat and allow you to control keep a certain temperature.

Popular gooseneck kettles are available from all the big brands in pourover coffee, such as the Hario Buono or the Fellow Stagg.

## A household kettle for heating, a gooseneck kettle for pouring

Before I got an electric gooseneck kettle, I used to heat the water in my electric household kettle and transfer it to a Hario Buono after boiling. I then poured the water from the Buono. Transferring the hot water just after the boil also allows it to cool down somewhat, which gives you temperatures better suited for brewing light roasts.
