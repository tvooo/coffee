# French press

The French press, also called _cafetiere_, is one of the most popular home brewers.

It is an [immersion brewer](./immersion) consisting of a jug and a plunger. To make coffee with a french press, you cover [coarse](./grind-size) coffee grounds with hot water. After waiting a couple of minutes, you slowly push down the plunger and the coffee is ready to be served.

French presses are cheap and widely available, and most often made of glass (although other materials exist).
