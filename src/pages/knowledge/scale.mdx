# Scale

If you want to get repeatable results when brewing coffee at home, or if you try to follow recipes you find online ([for example right here](/recipes)), you will need a scale.

Some scales have an integrated timer, and some even have a bluetooth connection and allow you to program recipes to follow.

You can use an ordinary kitchen scale, but they're often very inaccurate. If you don't want to spend a lot of money on a purpose-made coffee scale, you can buy a jewelry scale. These are more precise than kitchen scales and often quite cheap.

Popular coffee scales are the Hario V60 Drip Scale, the Bonavita Scale, the Brewista Smart Scale, or the Acaia Lunar and Pearl series. There are also many off-brand scales, as well as knockoffs of some of the more expensive products.
