# Grind size

The grind size influences the extraction â€” that is, the rate and intensity at which the coffee taste[^1] is extracted from your grounds.

Grind size is a great variable to play with when you want to dial in your recipe: keep the amount of coffee and water stable, try to pour at the same speed, but change the grind size.

Unfortunately, there is no good, universally accepted measure of grind size. It would be _so_ cool to just go to your local roaster and ask them to grind your beans to "size 418", or even to "0,3mm".

In practice, many coffee recipe talk about grind sizes in relative terms. It's a scale, and you can position the grind size for one brew method relative to another. For example:

- [French press](./french-press): coarse
- Chemex: medium coarse
- Kalita, V60 and Aeropress: medium
- Stovetop: medium fine
- Espressio: fine
- Turkish coffee: _really_ fine

[^1]: Ok, it's not strictly _a taste_ that is extracted here, but lots and lots of different chemicals that make up what you taste as coffee. But you get my point.
