      "1. Put your V60 on the pitcher. Give the paper filter a good rinse with hot water. It removes all paper taste and preheats the equipment. Remove the rinsing water.\n2. Weigh out 16 grams of coffee and grind on a slightly fine filter grind. Distribute the coffee evenly into the dripper, tare your scale and start the timer.\n3. Begin with a gently pour in the centre of the coffee bed. Allow the water to spread out and gently follow it out to the edges. Ensure the coffee bed is evenly wet. This ‘bloom’ should be achieved in 30 seconds for 60 grams of water.\n4. At 30 seconds begin to pour again, starting with slightly more velocity to ensure all the coffee bed is immersed in water quickly. Pour out in circles to the edges to achieve this before gently returning to the centre of the coffee. Remain pouring gently and slowly in the centre as close to the coffee bed as possible. You should reach 200 grams of water in 1 minute of brew time.\n\nContinue with a slow and steady pour in the centre of the coffee bed. Reaching 260 grams of brewing water in a 1.40 of brew time. The brew should be complete and stop running through shortly before 2 minutes and the final brew should yield 225 grams."

Grind: Grind your coffee beans to a medium grind setting. Add the coffee to the drip and tare your scale. Have your boiling water ready.\n3. Bloom: Start timer. Pour 30g of hot water to wet all coffee. Let it bloom for 30 seconds.\n4. Pour steps: At 30 secs: Pour in 70g water. Keep adding water in pulses. Don't let the waterbed dry and don't to too high. We recommend steps of 30-50g pours. Pour in circular motions and never onto the sides - stick with the inner ring of a bagel. Done!"
