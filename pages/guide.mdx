- Immersion vs drip
- Grind size: Different brew styles and preferences require different grind sizes.
- Bloom
- Wash out filter; rinse
- coffee to water ratio 0.07:1

OK!

### Equipment

At the most basic, all you need to make coffee is some ground coffee beans, hot water, and a vessel to mix those two in. That's it.

#### Brewer

The brewer is your basic device for making coffee. It's what will bring your coffee grounds together with your water.

Popular brewers are the french press, or cafetiere; the stovepot; different filter pourover brewers such as the Melitta, V60, or Kalita Wave; the chemex or the aeropress.

#### Grinder

Hand grinder, automatic grinder / electric grinder

A grinder is not strictly necessary for home brewing; you can get pre-ground coffee, or ask your local coffee supplier to grind the beans for you when you buy. However, freshly ground beans do make quite a difference in taste.

#### Scales

#### Gooseneck kettle

Kalita, Hario Buono... but also super cheap knockoffs and the little hand thingie i have in the office

For some brewers, like the french press, you can just use your standard hot water kettle, but for brewers where it's important to control the water flow, like the v60 or chemex, a good gooseneck kettle will help you immensely.
